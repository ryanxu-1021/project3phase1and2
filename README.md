# project3phase1and2

I use python to finish this project. And I choose the pytorch one. 
Since I have download the Anaconda. I use conda install pytorch to install pytorch.
The firsh thing to do is to train the model.

I trained the model named epoch 1. After it finished, it continue to train the next model. So, actually you can use any of them as you like.
And I choose to use the epoch 1.
Then when I was running generate.py, there is a error. It may only came up if you use the windows system.

So I change a bit of the code. Then it works.

And I get a txt called generate.txt. It have 1000 words. Some of them are just words. Others can make up some sentenses both readable and unreadable.
